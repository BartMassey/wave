WAVE -- WAVE format audio file IO library
version 0.1

This library provides Data.WAVE, a module for reading and
writing audio files in the WAVE audio format.  See the
Haddock documentation for the gory details.

I have used this code with ghc 6.6 and ghc 6.8 on Linux,
although the current cabal setup has only been tested with
cabal 1.2 and ghc 6.8.  It is a fairly standard
Hackage-ready package, to the extent I know how to construct
such.

This is definitely a simple implementation: a number of
"advanced" WAVE features are not supported (such as
nonlinear encodings), and non-WAVE audio files are in no way
supported.  I thought others might find it useful, though; I
also have released other code that depends on it.

Have fun with it, and let me know if there are problems.
