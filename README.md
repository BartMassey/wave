# WAVE format audio file IO library
Copyright &copy; 2008-2014 Bart Massey

This library provides `Data.WAVE`, a module for reading and
writing audio files in the
[WAVE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) audio file format.
See the Haddock documentation for the gory details.

This is definitely a simple implementation: a number of
"advanced" WAVE features are not supported (such as
nonlinear encodings), and non-WAVE audio files are in no way
supported.  I thought others might find it useful, though. I
also have released other code that depends on it.
